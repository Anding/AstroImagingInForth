## Next Steps for Astroimaging in Forth

1. Live testing 

2. Instrument driver code to utilize VT100UI.f

3. Develop further scripts

4. Example : a dedicated astro-focus package with a list of suitable focus stars

- Re-use skyregion code to find the nearest focus star

- Take subframes around the focus star for speed

- Adjust focus times to reduce saturation

- Ask Han for some saturation information in the analysis output files
