## Next Steps for Astroimaging in Forth

1. Live testing, improve script reporting with ForthVT100

2. Develop script-focus to utilize subframes, integrate with ForthASTAP

3. Develop script-model to handle model building through 10micron control words

4. Develop further scripts

5. Example: auto-flats

6. Example : a dedicated astro-focus package with a list of suitable focus stars

- Re-use skyregion code to find the nearest focus star

- Take subframes around the focus star for speed

- Adjust focus times to reduce saturation

- Ask Han for some saturation information in the analysis output files
